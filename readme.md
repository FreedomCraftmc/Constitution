# The Constitution of FreedomCraftMC

**Status:** Active

---

## Preamble

We, the players of FreedomCraftMC, establish this Constitution to create a fair and functional democracy on this server. This document defines how power is held, how laws are made, and how we hold each other accountable. Everyone plays by these rules — no exceptions.

---

## Article I - The Structure of Government

### Section 1 - The Four Branches

The government of FreedomCraftMC is divided into four branches. No branch may claim the powers of another except where this Constitution explicitly allows it.

The four branches are:

1. **The Government** — the executive branch, led by the President
2. **The Legislature** — the lawmaking branch
3. **The Courts** — the judicial branch
4. **The Office of the Administrator (OOA)** — the founding and emergency branch

### Section 2 - Separation of Powers

Each branch operates independently. A person holding a position in one branch may not simultaneously hold a position in another branch unless this Constitution says otherwise.

---

## Article II - The Government (Executive Branch)

### Section 1 - The President

The executive power of FreedomCraftMC is held by the President. The President is elected by the players and serves as the head of government.

### Section 2 - Elections

The President is chosen by a popular vote of all eligible players. Election rules, terms, and eligibility requirements shall be defined by law.

### Section 3 - The Cabinet

The President may appoint players to serve in the Cabinet. Cabinet members assist the President in running the government and may be removed by the President at any time. Cabinet appointments do not require legislative approval unless required by law.

### Section 4 - Powers of the President

The President may:
- Enforce passed laws
- Direct the Cabinet
- Propose legislation to the Legislature
- Veto legislation passed by the Legislature

A presidential veto may be overridden by the Legislature as defined by law.

### Section 5 - Limits

The President may not make law unilaterally. The President may not punish players without a ruling from the Courts. The President serves at the will of the people and may be removed through processes defined by law.

---

## Article III - The Legislature (Lawmaking Branch)

### Section 1 - Structure

The legislative power of FreedomCraftMC is held by a single house, the Legislature. The Legislature is made up of elected representatives of the players.

### Section 2 - Powers of the Legislature

The Legislature may:
- Propose, debate, and pass laws
- Override a presidential veto
- Amend this Constitution under the process defined in Article VII
- Approve or reject budgets and resource allocation as defined by law

### Section 3 - How Laws Are Passed

A proposal becomes law when it passes a vote of the Legislature and is either signed by the President or passes a veto override. The specific voting thresholds and procedures shall be defined by law.

### Section 4 - Limits

The Legislature may not punish individual players directly — that is the role of the Courts. The Legislature may not grant itself executive power.

---

## Article IV - The Courts (Judicial Branch)

### Section 1 - Structure

The judicial power of FreedomCraftMC is held by the Courts. The Court system consists of one Supreme Court. Additional lower courts may be established by law.

### Section 2 - Judges

Judges are appointed by the President. The number of judges, their terms, and removal procedures shall be defined by law.

### Section 3 - Powers of the Courts

The Courts may:
- Interpret laws and this Constitution
- Rule on disputes between players
- Rule on disputes between branches of government
- Strike down laws that violate this Constitution
- Review and rule on actions taken by the OOA

### Section 4 - Judicial Independence

Judges may not be removed for making unpopular rulings. Removal of a judge requires a process defined by law and may not be used as political retaliation.

### Section 5 - Limits

The Courts may not make law. They may only interpret and apply it.

---

## Article V - The Office of the Administrator (OOA)

### Section 1 - Purpose

The Office of the Administrator exists because this is a Minecraft server and certain technical powers — world editing, permissions, server management — exist outside the normal reach of democratic governance. The OOA holds these powers. This Article defines strictly how they may be used.

### Section 2 - The Administrator

The OOA is led by the Administrator. The Administrator holds the technical powers of the server. The Administrator is a permanent role and may appoint a successor. If no successor is appointed and the Administrator permanently leaves, succession procedures shall be handled by the Courts.

### Section 3 - Staff of the OOA

The Administrator may appoint other players to serve within the OOA. OOA staff operate under the authority of the Administrator and are bound by the same rules as the Administrator.

### Section 4 - The Powers of God

The Administrator and the OOA technically hold unrestricted technical power over the server. This Constitution does not pretend otherwise. However, the use of that power is strictly limited by this Article. Holding a power is not the same as having the right to use it.

### Section 5 - Permitted Actions

The OOA may only act in the following circumstances without explicit legal authorization:

**Founding Actions** — Actions taken during the initial setup and founding of the server, including world creation, initial permissions setup, and the ratification of this Constitution. Founding actions are considered complete once this Constitution is ratified.

**Emergency Judicial Actions** — When the Courts cannot function, when no law exists to cover an urgent situation, or when immediate server-threatening action is required, the OOA may act in a judicial capacity. This power is narrow and must meet all conditions in Section 6.

All other actions by the OOA require a law passed by the Legislature explicitly granting that power.

### Section 6 - Emergency Judicial Actions

An Emergency Judicial Action may only be taken when all of the following are true:

1. The Courts are unable to convene or rule in time to address the situation
2. No existing law covers the situation
3. Inaction would cause immediate and serious harm to the server or its players
4. The action taken is the minimum necessary to address the situation

Emergency Judicial Actions are temporary. They do not set permanent precedent and must be reviewed by the Courts as soon as possible.

### Section 7 - Mandatory Reporting

**Every action taken by the OOA must be immediately reported to the Government.** This is not optional. The report must include:

- What action was taken
- When it was taken
- Who took it
- Why it was taken
- What authority it was taken under

Reports are public record.

### Section 8 - Judicial Review of OOA Actions

Every OOA action is subject to review by the Courts. The Courts may rule an OOA action unlawful. If ruled unlawful, the action must be reversed to the greatest extent possible. The OOA may not interfere with or ignore a court ruling.

### Section 9 - Emergency Moderation Enforcement

The OOA may issue emergency moderation actions against a player without prior court approval when immediate harm to the server or its players is occurring or is imminent and there is no time to wait for the Courts or Government to act.

The following moderation actions are permitted under this section:

- **Temporary mute/silence** — preventing a player from communicating in chat
- **Temporary ban** — removing a player from the server temporarily

Kicks are not covered by this section as they are considered a lesser action and do not require constitutional authorization.

These actions are strictly temporary. They last only until the Government is able to take charge of the situation. Once the Government assumes responsibility, the OOA's moderation authority over that situation ends.

**Handoff to Government**

As soon as an emergency moderation action is taken, the OOA must immediately notify the Government. The Government then decides how to proceed. The Government may:

- Take over and pursue the matter formally through the Courts
- Decline to prosecute, ending the moderation action immediately
- Extend or modify the action through proper legal authority

Refusal to prosecute by the Government is a valid and final outcome. The OOA may not override or circumvent a Government decision not to pursue a case.

All emergency moderation actions are subject to judicial review. A player who has been muted or temporarily banned under this section has the right to challenge the action in the Courts.

---

### Section 10 - Limits

The OOA may not:
- Pass or veto laws
- Override a court ruling
- Act outside of Sections 5 and 6 without legal authorization
- Use technical powers to benefit themselves or allies without legal authorization
- Retaliate against any player or branch for challenging OOA actions

---

## Article VI - Rights of Players

### Section 1 - Basic Rights

All players of FreedomCraftMC hold the following rights. No branch of government may violate them.

1. **Right to participation** — Every player may vote, run for office, and propose legislation as defined by law.
2. **Right to due process** — No player may be punished without a fair ruling from the Courts.
3. **Right to appeal** — Every player has the right to appeal a court ruling.
4. **Right to information** — All government actions, OOA reports, and Documents are public record.
5. **Right to challenge** — Any player may challenge the legality of a government or OOA action in the Courts.

---

## Article VII - Amending This Constitution

### Section 1 - How to Amend

This Constitution may be amended by a vote of the Legislature meeting a supermajority threshold defined by law, followed by ratification as defined by law.

### Section 2 - What Cannot Be Changed

No amendment may:
- Remove the mandatory reporting requirement for OOA actions (Article V Section 7)
- Remove judicial review of OOA actions (Article V Section 8)
- Abolish any of the four branches
- Remove the basic rights in Article VI

---

## Article VIII - Supremacy

This Constitution is the highest law of FreedomCraftMC. Any law, action, or ruling that conflicts with it is invalid. When in doubt, the Courts interpret what this Constitution means.
